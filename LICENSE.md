# FERMET LICENSE AGREEMENT

**Version 1.0 — Effective Date: 1/11/2025**
**Company:** Gegamo Team

---

## 1. Overview

This License Agreement (“Agreement”) governs your access to and use of **Fermet**, a web-based application and website operated by **Gegamo Team** (“we”, “our”, “us”). By using Fermet, you agree to be bound by this Agreement. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

---

## 2. License Grant

We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use Fermet for lawful purposes only and in accordance with this Agreement. You do **not** own Fermet or any part of it.

---

## 3. Intended Use

Fermet provides a web-based browser that may allow users to access content restricted by local or institutional networks (such as schools). You are **fully responsible** for how you use Fermet.

You agree that:

* You will follow all laws, regulations, and network or institutional rules.
* You will not use Fermet to access or distribute illegal, copyrighted, or confidential content without authorization.
* Any consequences from misuse (disciplinary, civil, or criminal) are entirely your responsibility.

Fermet is a **tool**, not a loophole. Misuse it, and it’s on you.

---

## 4. Prohibited Uses

You may **not** use Fermet to:

* Break laws or institutional network policies.
* Perform or facilitate hacking, scanning, or unauthorized access.
* Spread malware, spyware, or phishing content.
* Impersonate anyone or misrepresent yourself.
* Reverse-engineer or modify Fermet’s backend, frontend, or functionality.

Violation of these terms will result in termination of access and possible legal action.

---

## 5. Disclaimer of Warranties

Fermet is provided **“AS IS”** and **“AS AVAILABLE.”**
We make **no warranties** — express or implied — including, but not limited to:

* Uninterrupted or error-free operation.
* Guaranteed bypassing of content restrictions.
* Security or anonymity while using Fermet.

You use Fermet **at your own risk.**

---

## 6. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law:

* **Gegamo Team** will not be liable for any damages (direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive) arising from your use or inability to use Fermet.
* Our total liability for any claim will **not exceed $100 USD** or the total amount you paid to use Fermet in the past 12 months — whichever is greater.

If you cause issues through misuse, you indemnify **Gegamo Team** against all resulting claims, costs, and damages.

---

## 7. Ownership

All intellectual property rights in Fermet — including design, code, content, branding, and related assets — belong to **Gegamo Team**.

You receive a **license to use**, not ownership.

If you submit feedback or suggestions, you grant us a **permanent, worldwide, royalty-free** right to use them without obligation.

---

## 8. Termination

We may suspend or terminate your access to Fermet at any time, for any reason, without notice — especially if you violate this Agreement.

Upon termination, your rights to use Fermet immediately end.

---

## 9. Modifications

We can update or modify this Agreement and the Fermet Service at any time. Updated versions will be posted publicly, and continued use means you accept the new terms.

---

## 10. Governing Law

This Agreement is governed by the laws of **the Kingdom of Bahrain**, without regard to conflict of law principles.

Any dispute arising under this Agreement shall be resolved exclusively in the courts located in **Manama, Bahrain**.

**In short:** Fermet is a tool, not a permission slip. You’re responsible for how you use it. We don’t guarantee anything, and we’re not liable for misuse or consequences.
